Random Scripts that I use in League Modding

## AnnouncerFix 
Take a new (14.23+) map11.py (converted from bin with ritobin) and revert the announcer system to pre-14.22 for use with custom announcers.

## Ahri Announcer Script
Uses AnnouncerFix as well as several other scripts and tools to fully automate the creation of the Star Guardian Ahri Announcer mod.
